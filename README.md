# Undead-breakout-survival-shooter

Overview

  This is a survival shooter game developed using Unity for my personal portfolio. The game combines fast-paced combat with strategic resource management as players fend off waves of zombies. It features three     unique weapons — a sword, a pistol, and a rifle — allowing for both close-quarters and ranged combat. While this project will not be published, it serves as a showcase of my technical skills in game              development.
  
Gameplay Features

Weapons:
  Sword: For close-range melee attacks, providing a tactical option when ammo is low.
  Pistol: A reliable, mid-range weapon with moderate damage and fire rate.
  Rifle: High accuracy and long-range combat for precision shooting.
  Zombie AI: Enemies are powered by Unity’s NavMeshAgent, allowing them to intelligently navigate the environment and chase the player.
  Resource Management: Defeated zombies drop ammo, and players must collect it to stay equipped for battle.
  Survival Mode: Players face increasingly difficult waves of zombies, requiring quick reflexes and strategic planning.
  
Project Features
  Raycast Shooting System: Precise, real-time targeting using Unity's raycasting for ranged weapons.
  Enemy AI: Zombies dynamically pursue and engage the player using Unity’s NavMesh pathfinding system.
  Weapons System: Easily switch between the sword, pistol, and rifle during gameplay.
  Ammo System: Zombies drop ammo boxes upon death, encouraging careful resource management.
  Immersive Visual and Audio Effects: Includes blood splatter effects, weapon muzzle flashes, and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
